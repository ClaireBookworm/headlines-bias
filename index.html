	<h1>Exploration of Wording in Headlines</h1>
	<script src="timeline_p5.js"></script>
	<p>Bias in Headlines and differences in use of active/passive language to ascribe things like blame or victimhood to various groups of people. We're going to be ooking at various headlines and seeing how news outlets might converge onto a singular “bias.” A good example would be comparing a headline that says “[X] group massacres [Y] civilians” or “[Y] soldiers slaughtered,” but then comparing that with “Thousands of [X] killed.” This difference in language and the difference in amount of coverage strongly biases the public and determines what is kept at the forefront of Americans’ minds.

	<p> Types of graphs we're going to be using: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Specific words we know are involved with bias (specifically, assigning blame): "stormed out", "slaughtered", "complains". Any words that might have connotations that show the bias of the reporter.</li>
		<li>Dating these headlines and correlations with the public opinion of people over the election timeline. </li>
		<li>Different news outlets and the types of headlines they are writing -> can use some sentiment analysis as well.</li>
		<li>Basic word frequency analyses as well for you to perform your own analysis.</li>
	</ul>
