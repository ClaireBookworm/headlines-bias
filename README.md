# Exploration of Wording in Headlines

*4.032 | Data Visualization | Spring 2024*

---

Every day, ~20.9 million newspapers and magazines are circulated and read by people of a huge variety of political stances, religious beliefs, life experiences, and identities. Yet, amongst the turmoil of current events today and the many arguments about media bias, one form of bias is less spoken about, which is how headline wording and word frequencies can impact the peoples’ thoughts and beliefs. 

Here, I break down headlines from the 2016-2020 presidency and how headlines, wording, and various trends came about during the time of President Trump’s term. Datasets were primarily obtained from Harvard’s Dataverse, a CNN headlines dataset, web-scraped from various news websites, from the Tyndall Report, and so on. 

This project takes a first stab at the types of data we have available and what sorts of explorations we can make.
