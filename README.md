Every day, ~20.9 million newspapers and magazines are circulated and read by people of a huge variety of political stances, religious beliefs, life experiences, and identities. Yet, amongst the turmoil of current events today and the many arguments about media bias, one form of bias is less spoken about, which is how headline wording and word frequencies can impact the peoples’ thoughts and beliefs. 

Here, I break down headlines from the 2016-2020 presidency and how headlines, wording, and various trends came about during the time of President Trump’s term. Datasets were primarily obtained from Harvard’s Dataverse, a CNN headlines dataset, web-scraped from various news websites, from the Tyndall Report, and so on. 

This project takes a first stab at the types of data we have available and what sorts of explorations we can make. 

**Here are some snapshots of what we found:**

A condensed version of the word frequencies, where the most common words are shown.

![Outlet Distribution](https://github.com/ClaireBookworm/headlines-bias/blob/main/screenshots/outlet_distribution.png)

The distribution of headlines by news outlet.

![Approval vs Frequency](https://github.com/ClaireBookworm/headlines-bias/blob/main/screenshots/approval_frequency.png)

The relationship between Trump's approval rating and the frequency of headlines mentioning him.

I'd really want to explore specific words we know are involved with bias (for example, assigning blame or disapprovement): "stormed out", "slaughtered", "complains". Any words that might have connotations that show the bias of the reporter. Here, the limitation lies much in the words chosen as having biased connotations and if they could be a complete list.
